"""
Unit tests for full application assembly in archer.app.

Isolation strategy
------------------
archer.app calls load_dotenv() and configure_logging() at module level, and
mounts a StaticFiles directory.  To prevent any real .env file from being read
during tests, dotenv.load_dotenv is patched to a no-op before the module is
imported.

The module is imported once inside a session-scoped fixture.  All tests that
need the app object receive it via that fixture.

Route-registration tests use a TestClient context manager rather than
inspecting app.routes directly.  Direct inspection of app.routes is brittle
across environments because route objects may not be flattened onto the app
in a consistent order on all platforms.  HTTP smoke tests are more robust:
each test confirms that a specific endpoint is reachable and returns the
expected status code for a safe, unauthenticated or invalid request.

Tests that exercise the lifespan event handler also use TestClient, with
verify_database patched via patch.object() on the already-imported
module, so no real IBM COS credentials, network access, .env file, or
sales.db are ever required.

No .env file, real sales.db, IBM Cloud, COS, watsonx, or network access is
required or permitted.
