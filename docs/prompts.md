# Prompts

The prompts live in [`prompts/`](../prompts) as versioned Markdown files rather
than as string literals in Python. They are the part of this system most likely
to change, most likely to change behaviour when they do, and least readable
buried in a source file. As files they can be reviewed and diffed like anything
else, and [`docs/evals.md`](evals.md) can attribute a change in accuracy to a
change in a prompt.

Each file carries front matter recording its version, purpose, placeholders and
what changed. The loader strips it before the model sees it.

## The pipeline

Three prompts, in sequence, with a routing decision between them:

```
question ──▶ classifier ──┬── "1" ──▶ sql_generator ──▶ SQLite ──▶ formatter
                          └── "2" ──▶ chat
```

Splitting classification from generation is the most consequential design
decision here. A combined prompt would have to decide *and* produce SQL in one
pass, and a model that has just been shown fifteen SQL examples will write SQL
for "hello". Separating them means the conversational path never sees the
schema and the SQL path never has to consider small talk.

## The classifier

**One job: output `1` or `2`.** No reasoning, no explanation.

The existence-check examples do most of the work and are deliberately first:

```
User Message: "Is there a partner called green?"
Classification: 1
```

Without them the model reads "Is there a partner called X?" as conversation and
answers from nothing. **That is the worst failure this system can produce:** a
confident answer about data it never looked at. A wrong SQL query returns
visibly wrong rows; a hallucinated "no, we have no such partner" is
indistinguishable from a real answer.

Five of the nine examples are existence checks for that reason. It is a
deliberate imbalance, not an oversight.

The classifier is allocated **five tokens**. It previously shared a 200-token
configuration with the SQL generator, which changed nothing about the output
and simply reserved capacity it could never use.

## The SQL generator

The large one, and the one that costs money: **2,013 input tokens on every
question**, almost all of it few-shot examples.

### What it is told

1. **Default columns.** Unless asked to aggregate, return a fixed set of eight
   columns rather than `SELECT *`. Someone asking to "see the deals" wants a
   readable table, not 37 columns of postcodes and contract numbers.
2. **Vocabulary mapping.** Domain words to columns: "partner" is
   `customer_name`, "hardware" is `item_group = 'IBM CCHW'`, and a "deal" is a
   `document_number` rather than a row.
3. **Column values.** Added in v3 - see below.
4. **Deal counting.** "How many deals" is `COUNT(DISTINCT document_number)`,
   because a deal spans several lines. Without this the model counts rows and
   over-reports by roughly 2.2x. It is the most dangerous error the system can
   make, because the answer looks entirely plausible.
5. **Subqueries for top-N.** "The three biggest deals" cannot be `ORDER BY
   revenue LIMIT 3` - that returns three *lines*. It needs a subquery that
   ranks deals by summed revenue and then returns all of their lines.
6. **Existence checks return names, not counts.** See below.
7. **A row cap** of 100.

### The two changes that mattered

**Existence checks (v2).** The model used to answer "is there a partner called
X?" with `SELECT COUNT(*)`. A count of zero cannot distinguish "no such
partner" from "the query was wrong", and it gives the user nothing to correct.
Returning matching names makes a near-miss visible: ask for "Galexy" and you
get back "Galaxy Crest Global PLC" and immediately understand what happened.

**Column values (v3).** The prompt described the columns but never the values
inside them. The model could not know that `document_type` holds `'Credit'`, or
that a flag is `'Yes'` and not `'Y'`, so it guessed - plausibly, and wrongly.
Three of the four baseline failures came from this, and **both models made the
same `'Y'` mistake independently**, which is what identified it as a gap in the
prompt rather than a weakness in the model.

The fix is a section listing the enumerable values verbatim. It is unglamorous,
and it took the suite from 89.3% to 100%.

**One disambiguation rule (v3).** A company name mentioned without the words
"end user" means `customer_name`. Previously the model chose between two
plausible columns with nothing to go on, and about half the time chose the one
the user did not mean. Ambiguity in the question needs a documented default in
the prompt, not a coin toss.

### What was tried and rejected

- **Dropping the few-shot examples** to cut the 2,013-token cost. The examples
  are what encode the deal-versus-line distinction and the top-N subquery
  pattern; describing those in prose did not survive contact with the model.
  The cost stands until there is a measured reason to change it.
- **Letting the model choose its own columns.** Produces a different shape for
  every question and makes the frontend's table rendering unpredictable.
- **A combined classify-and-generate prompt.** Fewer calls, but it writes SQL
  for greetings.

## The conversational prompt

Small, and mostly a set of refusals: answer in one line, no meta-commentary,
decline off-topic questions and steer back to the data.

The capability reply is a fixed string, deliberately. It answers "what can you
do", which is the first thing most people ask, and it is the one response that
should never drift.

Its dataset date range is **injected at runtime** from the database. It used to
be hardcoded, alongside "Current year: 2026" - the kind of detail that is
correct on the day it is written and quietly wrong from 1 January onwards.

## Prompt injection

User input is escaped before it reaches any prompt: braces are doubled and
triple-quote sequences removed, so input cannot terminate or restructure the
surrounding template.

That is a mitigation, not a solution, and the boundary is worth being honest
about. The real defences are downstream and structural:

- the generated SQL must start with `SELECT` or it is refused
- `ATTACH`, `DETACH` and `PRAGMA` are blocked, and statements are split on `;`
- the database is opened **read-only**
- results are capped at 100 rows

An injection that persuades the model to write `DROP TABLE` produces a refused
query and a log line, not a dropped table. **The prompt is not a security
boundary and is not treated as one.**

## Changing a prompt

1. Edit the file in `prompts/` and bump its `version`.
2. Record what changed, and why, in the front matter.
3. Run the evals before and after: `python evals/run_evals.py`.
4. Put the numbers in [`docs/evals.md`](evals.md).

Step 3 is not a formality. Moving these prompts from Python into files - a
change that altered no words at all - dropped accuracy from 89.3% to 10.7%,
because the loader stripped a trailing newline that told the model to start
writing on a new line. Every one of the unit tests passed. Only the evals saw
it.
